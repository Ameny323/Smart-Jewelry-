## 📦 Installation

1- Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ameny323/Smart-Jewelry-.git
cd Smart-Jewelry

2. Open the Project in Qt Creator
Launch Qt Creator.

Open the Gestion_Produit.pro file located in produis Directory.

3. Set Up the Database
Start WampServer.

Open your browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

Create a new database (e.g., bijouterie).

Import the SQL dump file located at:
database/bijouterie.sql

🔄 Update Database Connection
You will find a file named connection.cpp, which is responsible for configuring the database connection to MySQL.

To connect the application to your local MySQL database, follow these steps:

📁 Step 1: Open the File
Navigate to:
src/connection.cpp

🧩 Step 2: Locate the Following Code
#include "connection.h"

Connection::Connection(){}

bool Connection::createconnection()
{
    db = QSqlDatabase::addDatabase("QODBC");
    bool test = false;
    db.setDatabaseName("Gestion_Produit");  // Replace with your DB name
    db.setUserName("amani");                // Replace with your username
    db.setPassword("amani");                // Replace with your password

    if (db.open())
        test = true;

    return test;
}

void Connection::closeConnection() {
    db.close();
}

🛠️ Step 3: Customize the Configuration

| Code Line                               | Replace With                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `db.setDatabaseName("Gestion_Produit")` | Your database name (e.g., `"bijouterie"`) |
| `db.setUserName("amani")`               | Your MySQL username                       |
| `db.setPassword("amani")`               | Your MySQL password                       |


✅ Final Checklist: Ensure Successful Database Connection
Before running the application, make sure the following are in place:

✅ WampServer is running
Launch WampServer and verify that the icon is green in the system tray.

✅ MySQL ODBC 8.0 Driver is installed
You can download it from the official MySQL website if not already installed.

✅ Database exists in phpMyAdmin
Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin and confirm that your database (e.g., bijouterie) has been created and imported.

✅ Qt connection settings are correctly updated
Ensure you've modified connection.cpp with the correct database name, username, and password.

✅ Rebuild and launch the application
Press Ctrl + R or click Run in Qt Creator to start the app.
